          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            Web development involves creating websites and web applications, focusing on both the front-end (user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and back-end (server-side logic and databases using languages like Python, PHP, and Node.js). Full-stack development combines both aspects to manage entire projects.

          <h3>App Development</h3>
          <p>
            App development is the process of building mobile applications for devices like smartphones and tablets. It includes native development for specific platforms like iOS and Android, as well as cross-platform development using frameworks like React Native and Flutter to create apps that work on multiple platforms.

          <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
          <p>
            UI/UX design is about creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital products. UI design focuses on the visual elements and layout of a product, while UX design concentrates on the overall user experience, ensuring usability and satisfaction through research and prototyping.
